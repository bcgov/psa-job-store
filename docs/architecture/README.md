Architecture Diagrams have been created in [DrawIO](https://drawio-app.com/) format, as the file is in plain text format and can be version controlled.

To update the diagram, use the [online platform](https://app.diagrams.net/) or [install](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop) locally for offline use.  Optionally, export as an `.svg` and `.png` format (replacing the prior image).
