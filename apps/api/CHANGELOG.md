  - popover on orgchart now moves with the org chart when user pans
  - org chart now uses proper color scheme

  DevOps

  - update for prod deployment - update infra code and github action for applying database migrations to work with the crunchy db operator.
  - switch IS to use main-latest - the build scripts currently overwrite latest regardless of ENV. switch prod to use main-latest for now.
  - Change migrate-db action to use sidecar deployment, so its not dependant on a running API pod, which can be finicky in dev/test.
  - fix build-apps bug where the paths-filter is always using main branch for comparison
